THE WEEK THAT IT WAS...
The first week of Q2 in the Jubilee Year was a busy holiday week, with the Muslim world celebrating Eid Al-Fitr and the Buddhist world observing the Ching Ming Festival. Despite some bank holidays across Asia, investor focus was once again on PMI Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing data from China and the U.S., as well as the U.S. March Non-Farm Payroll report, the second since the "Disruptor in Chief" entered the White House.

China's PMIs for March showed modest improvements, aligning with typical seasonal patterns rather than signalling that the time to Make China Great Again has come. The official manufacturing PMI increased to 50.5 from 50.2, surpassing consensus, while the non-manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 from 50.4, also exceeding expectations. Within the non-manufacturing sector, services bounced to 50.3 from 50.0, and construction picked up to 53.4 from 52.7, marking a second consecutive month of gains. However, the broader growth outlook remains challenged, especially with the U.S. set to unveil reciprocal tariffs. Early signs of frontloaded government stimulus offer a glimmer of hope, which will be crucial for mitigating the impact of these trade tensions.

As the latest sign of the upcoming ‘Trump Stagflation’, the U.S. ISM manufacturing slipped back into contraction in March, with demand and output weakening, employment declining, and price pressures surging due to tariffs. The headline PMI fell to 49.0 (from 50.3), new orders plunged to 45.2, and production dropped to 48.3. Meanwhile, the prices paid index soared to 69.4, as rising metal costs and tariff uncertainty fuelled supply chain disruptions and stalled new orders.

Like manufacturing, U.S. service activity slowed in March, with respondents reporting front-loading of inputs and plans to pass on price increases tied to upcoming tariffs. The ISM Services PMI declined to 50.8 (from 53.5), while the employment index fell into contraction at 46.2 (from 53.9). Beneath the headline, the data was concerning employment plunged, new orders dropped sharply, and price pressures eased slightly.

Despite investor jitters from tariffs and DOGE-induced volatility, the U.S. economy defied expectations by adding 228,000 jobs in March, well above the 135,000 forecast and the prior month’s downwardly revised 117,000. Job gains were driven by education, transportation, and leisure/hospitality, while manufacturing, mining, and information sectors continued to lag. Government employment also ticked up, with a net gain of 19,000 jobs, as state and local hiring offset a 4,000-job decline at the federal level.
