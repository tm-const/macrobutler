      and the Buddhist world observing the Ching Ming Festival. Despite some bank holidays across Asia,
      investor focus was once again on PMI Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing data from China and the U.S.,
      as well as the U.S. March Non-Farm Payroll report, the second since the "Disruptor in Chief" entered the White House.

      China's PMIs for March showed modest improvements, aligning with typical seasonal patterns rather than signalling
      that the time to Make China Great Again has come. The official manufacturing PMI increased to 50.5 from 50.2,
      surpassing consensus, while the non-manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 from 50.4, also exceeding expectations.
      Within the non-manufacturing sector, services bounced to 50.3 from 50.0, and construction picked up to 53.4 from 52.7,
      marking a second consecutive month of gains. However, the broader growth outlook remains challenged,
      especially with the U.S. set to unveil reciprocal tariffs. Early signs of frontloaded government stimulus
      offer a glimmer of hope, which will be crucial for mitigating the impact of these trade tensions.

      with demand and output weakening, employment declining, and price pressures surging due to tariffs.

      while manufacturing, mining, and information sectors continued to lag.
